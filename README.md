## Why DevOps is import for WATonomous

DevOps enables everything else to work smoothly. Without DevOps, code linting wouldn't take place, thus no formatting standards or design conventions would be enforced. Code testing would be done only by the developers, so in other words it wouldn't be done. DevOps enables organizations with large numbers of users to stay on the same page and not have the codebase devolve into a complete mess (or at minimum delay the descent into madness). DevOps is the backbone of a successful team.
